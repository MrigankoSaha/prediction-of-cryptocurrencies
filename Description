# Cryptocurrency price prediction using neural networks and forecast using time series.
## Project overview

This project, developed collaboratively by a team of three members,
focuses on building predictive models for forecasting the prices of popular cryptocurrencies:
Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. 

Using advanced time series forecasting techniques and deep learning models (neural networks), 
the project aims to provide dynamic and reliable predictions to support investment strategies and risk management decisions.

## Objectives

Predict future price movements for Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum to help investors and stakeholders make informed financial decisions.
Leverage real-time data from cryptocurrency APIs to ensure dynamic and up-to-date forecasts.
Evaluate and optimize predictive models using performance metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
